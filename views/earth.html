    According to the NASA website, Earth is the third planet from the sun right after Venus. Like Mercury, Earth is
    rocky with a solid but active surface and like Venus, it has mountains. However, Earth also has valleys, canyons,
    plains, oceans, and more. Actually, the ocean makes up about 70% of Earthâ€™s surface! We know that a day on Earth
    lasts about 24 hours, however, not many know that a year is 365.25 days which is why we need leap years.
